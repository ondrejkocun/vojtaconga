Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad just 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm living through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the low and then that's what I send it to
I was forgetting you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want, and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em "sorry", they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't delivering Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God everyday, that's my bestie
They playing soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me as soon she met me
We both got it bad, mama, bag is more heavy
We have to stop counting, it's getting too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how he bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid-kid-kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib
Pray for what folks them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off his list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-a-adam could never be bla-a-ack
'Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, rib
